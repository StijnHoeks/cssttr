# CSS To The Rescue

Minor: Web Development, HvA, Amsterdam

This assignment is all about CSS, building a website from scratch composed sole out of HTML and CSS focussed on accessibility. The website is commissioned for a fictional user, Marijn (he himself actually isn't fictional, but the assignment is). Marijn doesn't use a mouse or trackpad, he almost exclusivly uses his keyboard, navigation his through the web with the (shift-)tab key and other shortcuts. Of course we still had to take account for general accessibility features - for example - friendly and usable interfaces for people with colour blindness. In practice this meant: an unobtrusive interface with fully designed ::focus, ::hover, ::active and ::checked states used to supply feedback.

During this project I made use of various techniques, some of which I rarely used before like 'grid' and 'CSS variables'.
